I’m a young  developer who has turned months of freelancing into a full-time career.
Being a developer allows me to not only develop  apps and websites but also develop it with cutting edge backend support.

I specialize in building robust backends that do all the heavy lifting for your app or website. 
I love designing systems that are light yet powerful, distributed yet synchronized and beautiful yet effective. 
I also frequently blog about the world behind the screen which involves system designs, databases, security.
